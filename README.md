# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description 

This repository ("Horiseon Code Refactor") aims to simplify, condense and streamline both the existing HTML and CSS so that the remaining code has ease of use and can be easily read/edited for further use. The client, as a marketing agency, required a website that both followed accesibility standards to optimise seo and looked good doing it. The resulting code has solved such issues like long-winded code, trimming attributes in the CSS so that multiples are not clogging up the style sheet and making sure they co-exist with one another so that the page remains functional.

## Usage 

This application was created to aid in comprehending HTML semantics and incorporating effective yet coherent ways to write CSS so that they might co-exist seamlessly. Editing the existing HTML was extremely important, to aid further development, future developers will now be able to understand, read and edit as needed without issue.
With regards to the use of CSS, it has been made cohesive, using existing classes and refactoring them so that they are both condensed and remain useful to aid the HTML. In this use case, targeting tags instead of classes if they appear only once, will make the style sheet easier to manage and visualise.
